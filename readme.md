Fetch a list of photos from Flickr.com and display it in html.

## About
I'm building this application as I follow the example project from James Sinclair's [*A Gentle Introduction to Javascript Test Driven Development*](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-javascript-tdd-intro/). This application is being developed to deepen my understanding of TDD as it applies to Javascript run in a browser.

## Setup
Requires NodeJs.
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Tests
Tests are run on the command line using Mocha. `npm test` will run all tests.

## Key Libraries
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
[Chai Assertion Library](http://www.chaijs.com/)
